At times, we might feel a certain inability to move on from someone for whom we have deep feelings for. Someone who won't like us back despite our valiant efforts and good charms.

We tell ourselves stories about how they're everything we are looking for. We imagine what it would be like if they saw us in a different light. What would it be like to kiss them? To date them?

There's not much we can do about someone else's feelings. And moving on is often the only sensible option.

We can remind ourselves that the appealing aspects that make us fall head over heels for someone are not exclusive. â€” We might be able to find them elsewhere if we take our time to dissect and identify the tiny things that make us like someone in the first place.
