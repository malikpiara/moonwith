At times, we may feel a certain inability to move on from someone we have deep feelings for. Someone who won't reciprocate our affection despite our valiant efforts and good charms.

We tell ourselves stories about how they are everything we are looking for. We imagine what it would be like if they saw us in a different light. What would it be like to kiss them? To date them?

There is not much we can do about someone else's feelings. And moving on is often the only sensible option.

We can remind ourselves that the appealing aspects that make us fall head over heels for someone are not exclusive. We may be able to find them elsewhere if we take the time to dissect and identify the tiny things that make us like someone in the first place.
