It’s easy to overlook the present, when we are too focused on anticipating what’s coming. On chasing goals. Painting dreams.

It can be important to stop and realise that, what we use to define “these days”, will soon define “the good old days”. — The place we live in. Our circle of friends. What we look forward to, when we wake up. Or when we go to bed. Everything must change, because that’s what time is made of. Change.

Looking back, we become enamoured with the “good old days”. But they won’t happen again. And neither will today.

What are you grateful for today? And how would you go about showing someone that you care for them?
