Knowing everything about anything is impossible. When we see ourselves as experts, we can easily become blindsided.

Even Steve Jobs had the humility to know and to openly admit that he could not predict where technology was going to be in five years.

Regardless of how much you learn. Regardless of the recognition you may get over time. â€” Never forget to cultivate and treat the knowledge you acquire with the humility it begets.
