The actions we take are informed by how we see the world. 
When we see our abilities as something that can't change, we're operating under a fixed mindset. When we see our abilities as something that can be nurtured and developed like a muscle, we're adopting a growth mindset.

The ideas that underlie the growth mindset as coined by Carol Dweck were first introduced to me by Khan Academy when I was seventeen years-old. These ideas were life-changing and foundational. Coming to the absurd realisation that Shakespeare had to learn his abcs like the rest of us. Or that there had been a time in his life where Einstein understood maths in a shallower way than we do was eye-opening and altered the course of my life.

Back then, I was undertaking a vocational high school degree instead of a traditional one. This was a decision I made out of fear after having failed tenth grade. At that time, I believed my ability to learn maths was limited. This belief was heavily reinforced by my environment at home and in school.

The new-found realisation empowered me to take a stance. I had a hard conversation with my dad and went back to a normal high school in the following year to study science and technology. With advanced courses in maths, physics and biology. Something that was unimaginable a couple of months before that. I went on to do so much more than I ever deemed possible. From learning how to sing, to starting a band, to building a company.

People that share a growth mindset are more likely to seek out challenges and persist when they hit a roadblock. Failure is not seen as a source of shame or embarrassment. Rather as an opportunity for personal and professional growth.

9 years ago I saw the premise of the growth and fixed mindsets as diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Now I understand that life is often more complex than we make it out to be when we're young. Even though we often operate predominantly under one of the two mindsets, we're all prone to adopt aspects of the fixed mindset. This is the case whenever we're learning a new skill and work in an environment where our competency is lower than our peers. Or when we get fired or laid off and struggle with job safety.

We often work in teams where people have different levels of experience. This can affect us. And it can also affect of our peers and their motivation. But there are things we can do to cultivate a culture of growth.

We can share our work and the process behind the final result more openly, with the flaws and parts we feel less proud about. Doing so is an act of courage and generosity. It helps others realise that there's nothing wrong with showing work that feels raw. It helps less experienced folks realise that they can improve.
