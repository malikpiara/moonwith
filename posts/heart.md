For most of our lives, we have been conditioned to think primarily through the lenses of language. At a tender age, many of us put together and learned to feed an inner voice or internal dialogue. With time, we may have lost touch with other parts of our nature.

Words can do so much for us. But our ability to reason goes way beyond what we can verbalise. The heart. The gut feeling. â€” We know more about what is important or about what is right than we let ourselves believe. But sometimes it is hard to listen. It is easier to mute a beautiful, inherent part of our experience of the world than to trust something no one ever taught us how to deal when we were kids: How to use our intuition?

One way we can cultivate our intuition is by journaling. Or by asking ourselves every other Sunday: "What do I need right now?", "What's important for me?"
