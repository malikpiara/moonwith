Every now and then, we can find tiny little monsters lurking around the corner. Mental setbacks. Fear. A lingering feeling of anxiety we can't seem to shake off.

These tiny little monsters always seem to find their way back to us. And our natural instinct can often press us to hide or run away. But doing so won't make them go away.

One way of dealing with them may be to see these monsters as holes that have been carved on a young tree. The holes don't disappear. But after some time, they are too small to make or define the mighty tree.

Past experiences shape us. Some may pierce our soul and leave us scarred. But they don't have to define us.
