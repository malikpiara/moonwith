The reason I call myself Product Enabler instead of Product Manager is because the latter fails to capture the essence of the job. 

Some misconceptions about the role of product managers is that their job is to manage people. Or to manage projects. Although both **can** be part of the job description, product management is essentially about decision making and an ability to collect and connect multiple insights to build something people want.

Bad product management is applying tools and methods for the sake of them. Product enablement is about leading with empathy. Seeking understanding and empowering everyone around us to do their best work by providing them context, listening and being of service.

Job titles matter because they inform our behaviour. And what other people expect of us. It might be time to move on from product management towards product enablement.
