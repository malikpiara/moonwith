As we go through life, we find ourselves in different places. Different chapters. Weeks, months and years go by. Work gets in the way. We get busy and without meaning to, relationships that used to be everything fade away.

We may tell ourselves a different story. Like how real friendships last forever. However, friendships have to be earned. If we really care about them, we have to put in the effort.

One thing we can do is to schedule time to be with the people we care about.

Even though it may feel unnatural, setting time in advance ensures we get to spend quality time with the people who are important. No matter how much work we have in our hands.
