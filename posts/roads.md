Sometimes we're headed towards a dead end. And we keep on driving.

Some part of us knows we'll be in trouble soon and yet we hit the accelerator. And we come up with a thousand stories: There might be more to it than what meets the eye. We might get what we need it if we just keep on going. We might be able to break the wall if we're clever about how we go about it.

Trying to break a wall that doesn't want to be broken might just end up breaking us. â€” And to think there are other roads out there. Roads that might be worth waiting for. Roads that might get excited to have us riding them.
