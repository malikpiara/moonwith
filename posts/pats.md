Most people you interact with will show you some kind of support if given the opportunity. And although support is nice, you need to learn how to create a filter. Words are nice but they're easy. Most people say nice things because they want us to like them or because that's their default.

Accepting criticism and a certain kind of inquisitiveness can be hard. It can feel like a personal attack or lack of belief in our capabilities. And it hurts when it comes from the people we love the most. But that's often what we need to grow.

**Build the habit of reflecting on why people say what they say. What are they trying to achieve?**

**a)** Hold on to people who give you a hard time. It often means they care so much that they are willing to make you deslike them a little.
