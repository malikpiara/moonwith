When we decide to pursue an important goal, everything else we say yes to adds up. Like tiny drops of water that are poured into a bucket. When the bucket is empty, we can run. As it fills, it becomes heavier. — A bucket that took no conscious effort to carry around, suddenly becomes something we have to actively manage. It becomes a distraction. When it’s full, we can barely walk. We make progress slowly. We spend almost as much energy trying to keep the water in as we do trying to reach the finish line.

Saying no is hard. It takes courage. It takes discipline. Sometimes, it takes everything we have. But that might be worth it when that’s all we have to do in order to start running again.
