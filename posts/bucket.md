Goals are paths with a finish line. When we decide to walk a path, every little thing we say yes to adds up. Like droplets of water leaking into a bucket.

When the bucket is empty, we can run. As it fills, it becomes heavier. It becomes a distraction and we take longer to reach the finish line. When it’s full, we can barely walk. We make progress slowly. We let water pour out.

As the water falls, the path gets muddy. The things we said yes to come back to haunt us. We fail others. We fail ourselves. Motivation dims out.

Saying no is hard. It takes discipline. It takes life experience. Sometimes it takes everything we have. But saying no might be worth it when that’s all we have to do in order to start running again.
