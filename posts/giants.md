The giants we learn about in school. The ones whose shoulders we stand on, were once small. Smaller, less experienced than us. They worried, many times, about crashing. Or about making fools out of themselves. They worried about dying alone.

It can be comforting to know we are all lost. Swirling around this blue planet, somehow, never feeling like we're good enough. Thankfully, it's not about whether we're good enough or not. — It's about who we want to be. Where we want to go. What we want to achieve. And we don't have to listen to the inner voice telling us we're not good enough. Because in the end, that doesn't matter. No one ever became president or broke a global record by accident.

What matters is the goal, the trajectory, our willingness to show up and do the work. The giants we celebrate today probably knew that no one can score without a goal. They took their time to define where they wanted to go. And they kept going. They were bold enough to keep showing up. And they kept growing. — We are perfectly capable of doing the same.

We're capable of daring to go where no one else went before us. Because we're capable of showing up. If we fail, we can get up and try again. And we can keep trying. And we can keep showing up. Until we become the person we ultimately know we can be.
