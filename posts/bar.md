In everything we do, there is a threshold or shared understanding of "good enough". Okay. Sufficient. Average.

Large language models and machine learning are knocking on the door. And while their transformative power can be hard to predict, there is one thing we can be certain about. This technology will set a new, higher, unprecedented standard for the work we put out there.

Output that used to be good will soon become mediocre because now we have tools that can do better. So the only option we have left is to embrace technology and accept the call to level up. To collectively improve our ability to learn and to produce work that has higher quality.

But this time, we'll keep raising the bar. Good things are coming.
