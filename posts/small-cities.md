There's something irresistibly charming about smaller cities. They bring us closer together. They provide a sense of community. Intimacy. They bring forward our caretaker traits.

As remote work becomes the norm, smaller cities will slowly supersede large metropolises. Unlike big cities, small places don't have to compromise. They can appeal to a narrow tribe of people connected by the same values or passions.

In the future, the most driven and like-minded people won't have to live in big urban areas anymore. Knowledge will no longer be centralised around large cities. In order to come across the most interesting, thought provoking and creative people, we might have to go to small towns.
