People who thrive are people who grow in an extraordinary way. They are arguably different than they were one year ago when it comes to the skills they have and the way in which they operate.

It's hard to spot them because you have to know someone and their work well enough to be able to tell the difference.

I think a key distinction resides in the mindset. **People who are afraid of embarrassment donâ€™t thrive.** So don't be someone who's afraid of embarassment. Understand that every mishap is an opportunity to learn.
