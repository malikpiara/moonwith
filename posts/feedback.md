Throughout life, some people will be kind enough to provide us with negative feedback on matters that are sensitive to us.

At times, it will feel unfair or unjustified. Either because of the way the feedback was given. Or because it relates to our sense of identity. But we can learn to see feedback as an opportunity for growth and reflection.

**a)** Take negative feedback as a warm hug. A gift you can use to grow.

**b)** Next time someone gives you feedback, resist the urge to defend yourself. Listen attentively. Thank the other person for giving you their time and mental space.
