The idea that someone should have to meet requirements like a certain age or height. Or belong to a certain circle to become a suitable partner might not be serving us.

We might be hurting our chances at finding deep connection because we haven't given enough thought to what might, in fact, make us happy.

The connection and intimacy we long for might be out there for us to grab if we decide to open ourselves to other worlds. If we decide to widen our criteria. If we decide that other people's perception of us can't be more important than our own.
