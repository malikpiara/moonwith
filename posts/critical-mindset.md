The knowledge, tools and frameworks  we learn about in the classroom or in our industry were created by people like us.

Just because something is presented as the default way of doing things, it doesn't mean it is the best approach. Or correct.

Are we accepting what someone else teaches us because they hold some authority or because it's the easy thing to do?

People who care about progress, care enough to take a step back and reassess the current state of affairs. â€” The mindset is not the one of a contrarian. Or of someone who thinks they're wiser than everyone else who came before them. It's about courage, kindness and integrity with ourselves, our peers and the world at large.

**Do we ask ourselves enough times:**
- Does this make sense?
- What are we actually trying to achieve with this method or tool? Are we using it blindly or in an intentional way?
- Could there be a better way?
- What would we improve or do differently?
