Years of peer pressure, along with the expectations and shortcomings of our caretakers may have caused us to color inside the lines one too many times. Along the way, we may have forgotten how to fully express ourselves. Like a muscle that gradually wastes away when we don’t use it.

When we are bold, when we express ourselves without fear, we issue other people an invitation to do the same. We create new rules. We start a transformation. And that’s how culture changes.
