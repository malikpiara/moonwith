We can choose to be surrounded by people who inspire us. People who bring out the best in us. People who make us better every day, just because of their presence.

If there's someone out there who is like the kind of person we want to be, we can choose to engage them. Captivate them.

The people we spend time with are our future. â€” The things we eat. The thoughts we have. The beliefs we develop. The goals we define.  Everything's shaped in a way or another by their presence.

Who are you choosing?
