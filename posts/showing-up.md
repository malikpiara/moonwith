Building up a new skill or working towards a new goal can be frustrating. Especially when we're just getting started. Our output is often below the level we're acquainted with. And feeling our work is below average can be frightening.

A proven way to get better is to show up consistently. To put in the work on sunny days and rainy days. To show up, even when we feel we're not good enough.

Because it doesn't matter how good we are. What matters is the trajectory. â€” How good we aim to become. And how much we're willing to improve by deliberately deciding to show up.

With every little step we grow bolder. We grow our confidence. And, slowly, without realising, we can reach a level that might end up surprising us.
