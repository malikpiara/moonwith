Heartbreak is inevitable. Anyone capable of love goes through one at some point in their life. We cannot avoid wounds and bruises but we might be able to reframe them.

The story we tell ourselves as we're sulking and going through the motions matters. We can see our distress as an opportunity for a deeper level of self-knowledge. Use the time to rediscover old passions. Cultivate friendships. Gain perspective.

We might not be able to control every aspect of a relationship. Or how a certain person might feel about us. But we're able to shape our mindset.

A positive mindset. A mindset of self-compassion will give us the insight we need to keep moving.
