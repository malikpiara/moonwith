30 days of deliberate practice can help us become substantially better at any given skill. [We don't have to wait around hoping for someone to pick us or our work. We can pick ourselves. Show up. Do the work. Every day.](https://moonwith.com/posts/train)

The 30 Day UI Challenge is an excuse to learn and improve our design craft and that muscle of consistency. Every day, you’ll get a different prompt in your inbox. This is an opportunity to build the muscle of consistency and deliberate practice. And to do so with a community of people who are here to support you.

I issued this challenge to students at [CODE University](http://code.berlin/) and now we’re opening it to the public. Anyone can join and participate remotely and asynchronously.

### When?
It will start on **May 24th** and end on **June 24th**.
On weekends, there will be prompts too but it’s up to you to decide whether you want to take them or not.

You can share your work on Instagram, Twitter and Dribbble with the hashtag **#30dayUI** so we can find your work and support it.
